# Simple Transformer

## Overview

The **Simple Transformer** is an implementation of a transformer model using Object-Oriented programming in PyTorch. This repository serves as a foundational building block for anyone interested in understanding and experimenting with transformer architectures, enabling you to dive into the rapidly evolving world of AI.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Enwik8** dataset, which consists of 100 million characters divided as follows:
- **Training set**: 90 million characters
- **Validation set**: 5 million characters
- **Test set**: 5 million characters

The model is evaluated based on bits per character (BPC) on the test portion of the dataset.

## Features

- Object-Oriented implementation of the transformer architecture.
- Easy to extend and modify for experimentation.
- Comprehensive training and evaluation routines.
- Utilization of the Enwik8 dataset for benchmarking.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- NumPy


You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simple-transformer.git
cd simple-transformer
```

### Run the file using Visual Studio
 I have developed the program in visual Studio.



### Training the Model



## Results

The model's performance is measured in bits per character (BPC). Result are seen in the terminal after training of 10 hours with RTX 3090/4090 you will see output similar to this picture
